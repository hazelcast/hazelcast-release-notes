=== New Features

*_Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise New Features:_*

* **Blue-Green and Disaster Recovery for Java Clients:** Introduced
the support for Hazelcast Java clients to switch between alternative
clusters. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/index.html#blue-green-deployment-and-disaster-recovery[Blue Green Deployment and Disaster Recovery section].

*_Hazelcast IMDG Open Source New Features:_*

* **CP Subsystem:** Implementing the https://raft.github.io/[Raft consensus algorithm],
Hazelcast introduces its CP subsystem which runs within a Hazelcast cluster and
offers linearizable implementations of Hazelcast's concurrency APIs. See the
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/index.html#cp-subsystem[CP Subsystem chapter].
* **Querying JSON Strings:**  You can now query JSON strings stored inside your
Hazelcast clusters. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/#querying-json-strings[Querying JSON Strings section].
* **Pipelining:** Introduced pipelining mechanism using which you can send
multiple requests in parallel to Hazelcast members or clients, and read
the responses in a single step. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/index.html#pipelining[Pipelining section].
* **Support for Multiple Endpoints When Configuring Member’s Networking:** Added the
ability to configure the Hazelcast members with separate server sockets for
different protocols. See the
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/#advanced-network-configuration[Advanced Network Configuration section].
* **YAML Configuration Support:** Added the support for configuring Hazelcast
in YAML. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/#configuring-declaratively-yaml[Configuring Declaratively with YAML section].

=== Breaking Changes

* Support for JDK 6 and 7 has been dropped. The minimum Java version
that Hazelcast supports now is Java 8. See the 
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/#supported-jvms[Supports JVMs section].

=== Enhancements

*_Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Enhancements:_*

* **Sharing Hot Restart `base-dir` among Multiple Members:** The base directory
for the Hot Restart feature (`base-dir`) is now used as a shared directory between
multiple members, and each member uses a unique sub-directory
inside this base directory. This allows using the same configuration
on all the members. Previously, each member had to use a separate directory
which complicated the deployments on cloud-like environments. During the restart,
a member tries to lock an already existing Hot Restart directory inside the base
directory. If it cannot acquire any, then it creates a fresh new directory.
See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/index.html##configuring-hot-restart[Configuring Hot Restart section].
* **Lower Latencies and Higher Throughput in WAN Replication:** Improved
the design of the WAN replication mechanism to allow configuring it for
lower latencies and higher throughput. See the
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/index.html##tune-wr[Tuning WAN Replication For Lower Latencies and Higher Throughput section].
* **Add/Remove WAN Publishers in a Running Cluster:** Introduced the
ability to dynamically add or remove WAN publishers (target clusters).
See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/index.html#dynamically-adding-wan-publishers[Dynamically Adding WAN Publishers section].
* **Automatic Removal of Stale Hot Restart Data:** Introduced an option that
allows the stale Hot Restart data to be removed automatically. See the description of the
`auto-remove-stale-data` configuration element in the
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/index.html#configuring-hot-restart[Configuring Hot Restart section].
* **Client Permission Handling When a New Member Joins:** Introduced a
declarative configuration attribute `on-join-operation` for the client
permission in the Security configuration (its programmatic configuration
equivalent is the `setOnJoinPermissionOperation()` method). This attribute
allows to choose whether a new member joining to a cluster will apply the
client permissions stored in its own configuration, or will use the ones
defined in the cluster. See the
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/#handling-permissions-when-a-new-member-joins[Handling Permissions When a New Member Joins section].
* **Automatic Cluster Version Change after a Rolling Upgrade:** Introduced
the ability to automatically upgrade the cluster version after a rolling
upgrade. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/#upgrading-cluster-version[Upgrading Cluster Version section].
* **FIPS 140-2 Validation:** Hazelcast now can be configured to use a
FIPS 140-2 validated module. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/#fips-140-2[FIPS 140-2 section].

*_Hazelcast IMDG Open Source Enhancements:_*

* **Client Instance Names and Labels:** You can now retrieve the names
of client instances on the member side. Moreover, client labels have
been introduced so that you can group your clients and/or perform special
operations for specific clients. See the
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/index.html#defining-client-labels[Defining Client Labels section].
* **Composite Indexes:** Introduced the ability to recognize the queries
that use all the indexed properties and treat them as a composite, e.g.,
`foo = 1 and bar = 2 and foobar = 3`. See the
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/index.html#composite-indexes[Composite Indexes section].
* **REST Endpoint Groups:** With this enhancement you can enable or disable:
** REST API completely
** Memcache protocol
** REST endpoint groups 
+
See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/#using-the-rest-endpoint-groups[Using the REST Endpoint Groups section].

The following are the other improvements performed to solve the enhancement
issues opened by the Hazelcast customers/team.

* Improved the YAML configuration so that you can configure multiple WAN
member sockets. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14800[#14800] 
* Members now fail fast when the `max-idle-seconds` element for the entries
in a map is set to 1 second. See the note in the
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-dev/manual/html-single/#configuring-map-eviction[Configuring Map Eviction section]
for this element. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14697[#14697]
* Removed group password from the Hazelcast’s default XML configuration file.
Also improved the non-empty password `INFO` message. It's now only logged if
security is disabled, password is not empty and password is not the Hazelcast
default one. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14603[#14603]
* Improved the code comments for the `HazelcastInstance` interface.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14439[#14439]
* Improved the speed of partition migrations. This has been achieved by
sharing only the latest completed migration information with the members,
instead of sending the whole partition table after each migration.
Additionally, there was no need to send the completed migrations
to all cluster members after each migration. Instead, completed migrations
are sent to the source and destination members of the migration
inside migration operations. Remaining members, now, receive
the completed migrations in batches asynchronously.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14351[#14351]
* Improved the Javadoc of `HazelcastClient` so that the code comments now use
"unisocket client" instead of "dumb client".
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14213[#14213]
* Added the ability to perform an LDAP `subtree` search for groups in
Hazelcast Management Center’s LDAP authenticator.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14118[#14118]
* Added the ability to set the `EvictionConfig.comparatorClassName()` in
the client’s declarative configuration, too.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14093[#14093]
* Introduced the `/ready` endpoint to the REST API to allow checking a member
if it is ready to be used after it joins to the cluster.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14089[#14089]
* Improved the syncing of XSD files. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14070[#14070]
* The `IMap.removeAll()` method now supports `PartitionPredicate`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12238[#12238]
* Improved the diagnostics tool so that it automatically creates the
configured directory for the diagnostic outputs.

was causing some threads to remain open and the JVM could not be terminated
because of these threads. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13821[#13821]
* Fixed the discrepancy between the XSD on the website and the one in the download package.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13011[#13011]
* `PagingPredicate` with comparator was failing to serialize when sending
from the client or member when the cluster size is more than 1. This has been
fixed by making the `PagingPredicateQuery` comparator serializable.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12208[#12208]
