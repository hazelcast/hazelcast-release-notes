[[fixes-31212]]
=== Fixes

* When the in-memory format of a map is `NATIVE` and the uploaded user code
has missing classes (in case the user code deployment feature is used),
the resulting exception could not be seen on the client side when a map query is run.
This was causing the client to hang indefinitely and fixed by improving the
failure handling for this case.
