[[fixes-31212]]
=== Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the client could not receive an exception; when
the in-memory format of the map is `NATIVE` and the uploaded user code
has missing classes (in case the user code deployment feature is used),
the resulting exception could not be seen on the client side when a map query is run.
