== 4.1.6

[[enh-416]]
=== Enhancements

* Improved the log message that is displayed when using the `hazelcast.io.selectorMode`
property to decrease the high CPU usage. The previous misleading message read as
"Recreated Selector because of possible java/network stack bug". It has been changed
to "Selector was rebuilt, consider updating Java and/or your network stack drivers".
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19761[#19761]
* Introduced the `hazelcast.internal.map.expired.key.scan.timeout.nanos` property
to limit the execution time of the cleanup operations, i.e., entry expiration tasks of a map;
this is to prevent the increased CPU usage as the partition size grows.

=== Fixes

* Hazelcast was executing cluster wide operations when you query
the state of a member using the health check endpoint - it was causing to kill all the members
in a cluster; this issue has been fixed.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19837[#19837]
* The increment command (`incr`) in the Memcache client
was returning the ASCII code of the expected result; this interpretation
issue has been fixed.
