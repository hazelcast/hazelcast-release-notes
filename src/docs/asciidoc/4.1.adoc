== 4.1

[[nf-41]]
=== New Features

* **Instance Tracking:** It is a feature which writes a file on the Hazelcast instance startup
at the configured location. This file contains metadata about the instance, such as version, product name
and process ID, and it is not deleted on the member shutdown.
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.1-BETA-1/manual/html-single/#instance-tracking[Instance Tracking section^].
* **SQL Implementation:** Implemented the SQL engine that
supports map scans, index scans, projections and filters.
It also introduces the `hazelcast-sql` module to handle the
SQL engine's dependencies on Apache Calcite.
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.1-BETA-1/manual/html-single/index.html#sql[SQL section^].
* **Automatic Detection of Discovery Strategy:** It tries to automatically detect the
applicable discovery mechanism based on the runtime environment.
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.1-BETA-1/manual/html-single/index.html#auto-detection[Auto Detection section^].
* **Overriding Configuration:** You can now override the configuration entries
of your cluster without changing the declarative configuration files (XML/YAML).
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.1-BETA-1/manual/html-single/index.html#overriding-configuration[Overriding Configuration section^].
* **Auditlog:** This feature allows observing some important cluster events.
Auditable events have a unique type ID, and contain a timestamp and importance level.
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.1-BETA-1/manual/html-single/index.html#auditlog[Logging Auditable Events section^].

=== Enhancements

* **Improvements in Partial Network Disconnections:** Introduced properties
to be configured to detect and resolve the partial network issues among the
Hazelcast IMDG members.
See link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16680[#16680^] and the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.1-BETA-1/manual/html-single/#partial-network-partitions[Partial Network Partitions section^].
* **CP Subsystem Listeners:** Added membership and group availability
listeners for CP Subsystem.
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.1-BETA-1/manual/html-single/#cp-subsystem-listeners[CP Subsystem Listeners section^].
* **Trusted Interfaces:** It is now possible to restrict the source IP addresses
from which the Management Center operations are allowed.
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.1-BETA-1/manual/html-single/#limiting-source-addresses[Limiting Source Addresses section^].
* **Out-of-the-Box Kerberos Support:** Introduced support for Kerberos
authentication protocol which is one of the standard
solutions for single-sign-on. It also adds the GSSAPI authentication support in
LDAP configuration.
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.1-BETA-1/manual/html-single/#kerberos-authentication-type[Kerberos Authentication Type section^].
* **WAN Throttling Mechanism**: This prevents the WAN consumers from 
getting overloaded by the WAN producers if transferring the WAN events takes
less time than processing them in the target cluster. This can be the case with
WAN synchronization if the network latency is low enough. It can be configured using
the following properties:
** `hazelcast.wan.consumer.invocation.threshold`
** `hazelcast.wan.consumer.ack.delay.backoff.init`
** `hazelcast.wan.consumer.ack.delay.backoff.max`
** `hazelcast.wan.consumer.ack.delay.backoff.multiplier`

eliminate the latencies when these updates are sent to the clients by a member.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16939[#16939]

* Introduced the `forEach()` loop support for IMap.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16877[#16877]

`ObjectMultiMapProxy` -> `MultiMapProxyImpl`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16637[#16637]
* Improved the `computeIfPresent()` implementation so that now it keeps a
clone of the old/existing value and uses that for replace/delete operations.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16636[#16636]
* Introduced the `hazelcast.logging.details.enabled` property
to make the logging of cluster version, name and IP optional to

have been defined and mapped to the corresponding Java types.
Type information is used by executor stages to use the right strategy
of expression evaluation.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15241[#15241]
* Clarified the exception message when you connect to a cluster with an
invalid group name.

* Added a test for the `ClientConsoleApp` class. 
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12298[#12298]
* Improved the behavior of `ConcurrentMap.computeIfPresent`:
combined single client-server round trips instead of two (for `get` and
`replace` methods).

[[bc-41]]
=== Breaking Changes

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/17286[#17286]

operation was considering `CacheConfig` as resolved: it

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16594[#16594]
* Fixed an invalidation issue when using a transactional map
from a cache with a Near Cache: the cache invalidation event occurs

the entry was getting invalidated before the change is committed to the map.

* Fixed an issue where `InPredicate` was not invoking value comparison when the
read attribute is null.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15100[#15100]
* Fixed an issue where Map, Cache, MultiMap data structures
were returning negative values (`size()`) when the size is more than
`Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14935[#14935]
