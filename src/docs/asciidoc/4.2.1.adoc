== 4.2.1

[[enh-421]]
=== Enhancements

* Introduced a new mechanism in the background expiration tasks;
now a thread local array controls the allocations for these tasks
otherwise which may cause increased garbage collection pressure and
CPU usage spikes when you use aggressive expiration configurations,
e.g., low time-to-live values.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/18507[#18507]
* The log message for infinite cluster connection timeout is clearer now.
Previously, it was represented as the value of `Long.MAX_VALUE`.

[[fixes-421]]
=== Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the map's Near Cache was setting its maximum size as 10.000
even if the configured eviction policy is `NONE`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/18812[#18812]
* The LRU eviction policy now takes last access time value into account to prevent
premature removal of the lately added but not yet accessed map entries.
