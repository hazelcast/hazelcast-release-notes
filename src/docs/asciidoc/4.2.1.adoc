== 4.2.1

[[enh-421]]
=== Enhancements

* Fixed an issue where the maximum size policy for a map was being ignored
when the policy is `PER_NODE` and the cluster is scaled down
(due to losing or killing a member).
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/18873[#18873]
* The log message for infinite cluster connection timeout is clearer now.
Previously, it was represented as the value of `Long.MAX_VALUE`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/18648[#18648]
* Introduced a new mechanism in the background expiration tasks;
now a thread local array controls the allocations for these tasks
otherwise which may cause increased garbage collection pressure and
CPU usage spikes when you use aggressive expiration configurations,
e.g., low time-to-live values.

=== Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the updates made to a persistent map store might be lost
when the write coalescing is enabled.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/18929[#18929]
* Some merge policies like `LatestUpdateMergePolicy` for the map and WAN replication configurations
require the https://docs.hazelcast.com/imdg/4.2.1/data-structures/map.html#accessing-entry-statistics[per-entry statistics] to be enabled. Previously, this configuration inconsistency was causing the related member
to fail at runtime. Now, the Hazelcast member fails to start, i.e., fast fails, in such a case.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/18875[#18875]
* Fixed an issue where the map's Near Cache was setting its maximum size as 10.000
even if the configured eviction policy is `NONE`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/18812[#18812]
* The LRU eviction policy now takes last access time value into account to prevent
premature removal of the lately added but not yet accessed map entries.
