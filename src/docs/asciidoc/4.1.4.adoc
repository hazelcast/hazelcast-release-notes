[[fixes-414]]
=== Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the updates made to a persistent map store might be lost
when the write coalescing is enabled.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/18924[#18924]
* Fixed an issue where the maximum size policy for a map was being ignored
when the policy is `PER_NODE` and the cluster is scaled down
(due to losing or killing a member).
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/18871[#18871]
* Fixed an issue where the map's Near Cache was setting its maximum size as 10.000
even if the configured eviction policy is `NONE`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/18834[#18834]
* The LRU eviction policy now takes last access time value into account to prevent
premature removal of the lately added but not yet accessed map entries.
