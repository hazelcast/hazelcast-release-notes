== 4.0

NOTE: See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#upgrading-to-hazelcast-imdg-4-0[Hazelcast IMDG 4.0 Migration Guide^]
for the detailed guidelines to be followed when upgrading Hazelcast IMDG to 4.0.

[[nf-40]]
=== New Features

*_Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise New Features:_*

* **Persistent Memory Integration:** Added support for persistent memory,
such as Intel(R) Optane(TM) DC, to be used by Hazelcast's
High-Density Memory Store feature.
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/index.html#using-persistent-memory[Using Persistent Memory section^].
* **Encrypting Data in Hot Restart Store:** Provided a framework and implementation to encrypt
data in Hot Restart stores ("at rest") for data held in distributed structures.
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#encryption-at-rest[Encryption at Rest section^].
* **X.509 Certificate Authentication:** Added support for credential retrieval by the members
from the X.509 certificates configured on the clients.
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#tls-authentication-type[Security chapter^].
* **Out of the Box LDAP Configuration:** Introduced a new LDAP login module
where you do not need to provide your own JAAS login module for this purpose.
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#ldap-authentication-type[Security chapter^].
* **CP Subsystem Persistence:** Implemented persistency for Hazelcast's
CP (Consistency & Partition Tolerance) subsystem. 
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#cp-subsystem-persistence[CP Subsystem Persistence section^].

*_Hazelcast IMDG Open Source New Features:_*

* **CP Subsystem Development Mode:** Introduced `UNSAFE` mode for the CP data
structures. This way, you do not need to have at least three IMDG members
to use CP subsystem: you can benefit from its functionalities using only one
or two members.
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#cp-subsystem-unsafe-mode[CP Subsystem Unsafe Mode section^].
* **Bitmap Indexes:** Introduced this feature to significantly lower
index memory usage for low-cardinality columns and also to speed up
the queries and lower memory requirements for them
when the queries have multiple predicates acting on the same bitmap index.
Note that bitmap indexes usage, currently, is a good fit for
array/collection attribute indexing, rather than regular
single-valued attributes.
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#bitmap-indexes[Bitmap Indexes section^].

=== Breaking Changes

NOTE: Please see the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#upgrading-to-hazelcast-imdg-4-0[Upgrading to Hazelcast IMDG 4.0^] for the details of following breaking changes to be considered while upgrading to IMDG 4.0. 

==== Distributed Data Structures

* Externalized the hardcoded Flake ID Generator properties.
So the following constants are now in `FlakeIdGeneratorConfig`:
** `EPOCH_START`
** `BITS_TIMESTAMP`
** `BITS_SEQUENCE`
** `BITS_NODE_ID`
** `ALLOWED_FUTURE_MILLIS`
+
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16278[#16278]
* Removed the `values()` and `entrySet()` from map and replicated
map's `MBeans` since these are potentially dangerous operations that can
cause an `OutOfMemoryException` on the member since by default there is no
limit on how many entries can be returned as a response for a query.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16238[#16238]
* Changed the behavior of the `getAll()` method: when
either of the loaded key or value returned by the `MapLoader` is null,
this method now fails fast.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16204[#16204]
* Removed the `MapEvictionPolicy` class and its related
configurations. This has brought the following changes:
** `EvictionConfig` is used instead of `MapEvictionPolicy` for
custom eviction policies.
** `MapEvictionPolicy` has been removed and `MapEvictionPolicyComparator`
has been addd for the same tasks.
** `EvictionPolicyComparator`, `MapEvictionPolicyComparator` and
`CacheEvictionPolicyComparator` have become interfaces.
** Moved `EvictionPolicyComparator`  and `EvictableEntryView` to
the `com.hazelcast.spi.eviction` package.
+
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15939[#15939]
* Removed deprecated `IMap` methods accepting `EntryListener`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15781[#15781]
* Removed deprecated `DistributedObjectEvent.getObjectId`. 
The replacement is `DistributedObjectEvent.getObjectName`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15773[#15773]
* Removed the deprecated `getReplicationEventCount()` method of
local replicated map statistics.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15676[#15676]
* Removed the legacy `AtomicLong` and deprecated `IdGenerator`
implementations.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15601[#15601]
* Removed the legacy `ILock` implementation and
the `HazelcastInstance.getLock()` method. Instead
we provide the unsafe mode of CP Subsystem's `FencedLock`.
The `ICondition` is not supported anymore.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15625[#15625]
* Removed the legacy `AtomicReference` implementation and
the `HazelcastInstance.getAtomicReference()` method. Instead
we provide the unsafe mode for all CP data structures.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15593[#15593]
* Removed the legacy `Semaphore` implementation and
the `HazelcastInstance.getSemaphore()` method. Instead
we provide the unsafe mode for all CP data structures.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15539[#15539]
* Removed the legacy `CountdownLatch` implementation and
the `HazelcastInstance.getCountdownLatch()` method. Instead
we provide the unsafe mode for all CP data structures.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15538[#15538]
* Added `Nullable` and `Nonnull` annotations to IQueue, IMap,
`HazelcastInstance`, Cardinality Estimator, IExecutor, Durable Executor,
`QuorumService`, CP subsystem, logging service,
lifecycle service, partition service and client service.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15156[#15156],
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15003[#15003],
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15442[#15442],
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15842[#15842]
* Added null checks and annotations to `Cluster`, Ringbuffer, Replicated Map,
IList, ISet, ITopic and MultiMap interfaces.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15351[#15351],
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15220[#15220]
* Made the collection clones of IMap immutable so that
`UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown consistently
upon the attempts to update a collection returned by the `keySet`,
`entrySet`, `localKeySet`, `values` and `getAll` methods.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15013[#15013]

==== Distributed Events

* Removed the unused entry listener configuration code since
the return type of `getImplementation()` has been changed from
`EntryListener` to `MapListener`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16051[#16051]
* Fixed ``MemberAttributeEvent``s `getMembers()` method to return
the correct members list for the client.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15231[#15231]
* Refactored the `MigrationListener` API. With this change,
an event is published when a new migration process starts
and another one when migration is completed. Additionally,
on each replica migration, both for primary and backup
replica migrations, a migration event is published.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15071[#15071]
* Removed the backward compatible `ADDED` event from the
`loadAll` method.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14964[#14964]
* Refactored and cleaned up the internal partition/migration listeners:
** Renamed `PartitionListener` to `PartitionReplicaInterceptor` and
removed registering child listeners, which is not used.
** Renamed `InternalMigrationListener` to `MigrationInterceptor` and
converted to interface with default methods.
+
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15051[#15051]
* Added `EntryExpiredListener` to the `EntryListener` interface.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14959[#14959]

==== Configuration

* `CachingProvider` no longer resolves an URI as the instance name
since it was used both as the namespace for the cache manager and as a
means to locate a running Hazelcast instance.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15995[#15995]
* Removed the configuration for user defined services SPI.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15951[#15951]
* The group name in the client configuration renamed to cluster name.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15772[#15772]
* Unified `InvalidConfigurationException` and `ConfigurationException`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15132[#15132]
* Removed the deprecated `AwsConfig` getter/setter methods, e.g., 
`getAccessKey()`. They have been replaced with the `getProperty()`
methods, e.g., `getProperty("access-key")`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15758[#15758]
* Moved the following client statistics properties to the public `ClientProperty`
class.
** `hazelcast.client.statistics.enabled`
** `hazelcast.client.statistics.period.seconds`
+
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15752[#15752]
* Undeprecated the following group properties:
** `hazelcast.memcache.enabled`
** `hazelcast.rest.enabled`
** `hazelcast.http.healthcheck.enabled`
+
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15743[#15743]
* Removed the deprecated `get/setImplementation()` methods of
login module configuration. They have been replaced with
`get/setClassName()`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15729[#15729]
* Removed the deprecated `get/setPartitionStrategy()` methods of
`PartitioningStrategyConfig` configuration. They have been replaced with
`get/setPartitioningStrategy()`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15730[#15730]
* Removed the deprecated `get/setSyncBackupCount()` methods of
`MultiMap` configuration. They have been replaced with
`get/setBackupCount()`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15720[#15720]
* Removed the deprecated `get/setServiceImpl()` methods of
service configuration. They have been replaced with
`get/setImplementation()`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15680[#15680]
* Removed the `connection-attempt-period` and `connection-attempt-limit`
configuration elements. Instead, the elements of `connection-retry`
are now used.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15675[#15675]
* Renamed `MapAttributeConfig` as `AttributeConfig`. Also, its
`extractor` field is renamed as `extractorClassName`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15548[#15548]
* Improved the index configuration API so that now you
can specify the name of the index. Also, instead of boolean type,
you can use index type enumeration.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15537[#15537]
* Renamed the `group-name` configuration element as `cluster-name` and
removed the `GroupConfig` class.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15540[#15540]
* Removed the deprecated configuration parameters from
Replicated Map, i.e., `concurrency-level` and `replication-delay-millis`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15404[#15404]
* Removed the deprecated configuration parameters from the Near
Cache configuration.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15313[#15313]
* Moved the Event Journal configuration inside the map/cache
configuration. Before, it was configured as a parent-level
element.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15185[#15185]
* Moved the Merkle tree configuration under map configuration.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15180[#15180] 
* Removed the XSDs for Hazelcast IMDG 3.x versions.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15177[#15177]
* Removed deprecated client configuration methods such as
`isInsideAws()` and `newAliasedDiscoveryConfig()`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15012[#15012]
* Removed the `hazelcast.executionservice.taskscheduler.remove.oncancel`
system property and related methods.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14998[#14998]
* Changed the `non-space-string` XSD type to collapse all
whitespaces, so they are handled correctly in the declarative
Hazelcast IMDG configuration files.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14919[#14919]

==== Management Center

* Scripting is now disabled by default for both Hazelcast
IMDG Open Source and Enterprise editions. Previously, it was disabled
only for the Enterprise edition.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/16526[#16526]
* Removed all the codes providing HTTP based communications
between Hazelcast Management Center  and Hazelcast IMDG. Therefore:
** Removed the `MCMutualAuthConfig` class.
** Removed the `enabled`, `url`, `mutualAuthConfig`, and `updateInterval`
fields from the `ManagementCenterConfig` class.
** Declarative XML configuration simply looks like the following:
+
```
<management-center scripting-enabled="true|false"/>
```
** Declarative YAML configuration simply looks like the following:
+
```
management-center
  scripting-enabled: true|false
```
** Related REST API changes are as follows:
*** Removed the `/hazelcast/rest/mancenter/changeurl` endpoint.
*** Renamed `/hazelcast/rest/mancenter/security/permissions` as `/hazelcast/rest/management/security/permissions`.
*** Renamed the `/hazelcast/rest/mancenter/wan/\*` endpoints as `/hazelcast/rest/wan/*`.
*** Removed the legacy `/hazelcast/rest/mancenter/clearWanQueues` alternative URL in favor
of `/hazelcast/rest/wan/clearWanQueues`.

==== WAN Replication

* Aligned the naming of WAN classes, interfaces and getters/setters.
Some examples are listed below:
** `WanReplicationPublisher` -> `WanPublisher`
** `WanReplicationConsumer` -> `WanConsumer`
** `WanReplicationEvent` -> `WanEvent`
** `WanBatchPublisherConfig` -> `WanBatchPublisherConfig`
** `WanCustomPublisherConfig` -> `WanCustomPublisherConfig`
+
See https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16174[#16174] for
all the changes.
* Cleaned up the WAN publisher SPI to make it easier to implement integration between map/cache entry mutation and an external system.
+
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15195[#15195],
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15432[#15432],
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15527[#15527],
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16052[#16052]
* Replaced the `WAN` prefix of classes with `Wan` for the
sake of naming consistencies.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15571[#15571]
* Separated WAN private and public classes into different packages.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15195[#15195]

==== Split-Brain Protection and Split-Brain Merge

* Removed the dependencies on `Data` from the `SplitBrainMergePolicy`
API:
** The newly introduced `getRawValue/Key` methods (which supersede
the old getValue/Key) in `MergingValue/MergingEntry` classes
return the in-memory representation as `OBJECT`. The deserialized
value can be obtained using `getDeserializedValue/Key`.
** The merge types in SplitBrainMergeTypes no longer depend on Data.
Also, the value type has been removed from the various "view"
interfaces such as `MergingHits`, `MergingCreationTime`, etc.
** The new marker super-interface `MergingView` has been introduced that
all the "view" interfaces (including `MergingValue`) now extend.
** The generic type signature of `SplitBrainMergePolicy` has been changed
to specify the (deserialized) type of the merging value.
+
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16423[#16423]
* Introduced "split brain protection" concept to replace "quorum"
to make it more explicit and unambiguous. Classes and configuration
elements including the term "quorum" has been replaced by "splitbrainprotection".
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15444[#15444]
* Renamed the `isMinimumClusterSizeSatisfied()` method as
`hasMinimumSize().`
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15554[#15554]
* Removed the legacy merge policies specific to a data structure
in favour of generic merge policies.
** PASS_THROUGH
** PUT_IF_ABSENT
** HIGHER_HITS
** LATEST_ACCESS
+
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15292[#15292]

==== Serialization

* Now, `Data` and `SerializationService` are not exposed
in `ObjectDataOutput/Input` and `ObjectDataInput`,
respectively.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16064[#16064]
* Since `SerializationService` is now an internal API,
the implementations of `ObjectDataOutput` make use of
`SerializationServiceSupport` where serialization service
is needed in the user customizations.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16046[#16046]
* Added support for the following default Java serializers for collections:
** `ArrayDeque`
** `HashSet`
** `TreeSet`
** `TreeMap`
** `LinkedHashSet`
** `LinkedHashMap`
** `LinkedBlockingQueue`
** `ArrayBlockingQueue`
** `PriorityBlockingQueue`
** `DelayQueue`
** `SynchronousQueue`
** `LinkedBlockingDeque`
** `LinkedTransferQueue`
** `CopyOnWriteArrayList`
** `CopyOnWriteArraySet`
** `ConcurrentSkipListSet`
** `ConcurrentHashMap`
** `ConcurrentSkipListMap`
** `Map.Entry`
** `PriorityQueue`
+
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15371[#15371],
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16102[#16102],


==== REST

* Performed the following cleanups:
** Made all the HTTP status codes (including 200) to return a response body.
** The exception handling now always returns a HTTP 500 for an error.
** HTTP 400 is NOT returned now if any handler throws an
`IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
+
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16148[#16148]
* Aligned the output format of the REST API to return JSON:
** Changed the output format of the `healthcheck` and `cluster` URIs to return
JSON since the other URIs already return JSON.
** Now all the `POST` handlers use the `checkCredentials()` method
since it handles the case when there is no data sent.
** Now all the handlers use the common `prepareResponse()` method
which prepares the response for different response types appropriately.
** Expanded the return value of the `cluster` URI to return an array with
JSON objects for each cluster member so you do not need to parse the
member list but keep the list as a separate value.
** Added credentials checks to the WAN URIs.
+
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16087[#16087]
* Changed the `application/javascript` "Content-Type" header used
by REST API to respond to the JSON documents. Now, it uses
`application/json`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14972[#14972]

==== Distribution Package Changes

* Merged the client module into the core module: All the classes
in the `hazelcast-client` module have been moved to `hazelcast`.
`hazelcast-client.jar` will not be created anymore.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15366[#15366]

==== Query Engine API

* The Predicate API has been cleaned up to eliminate exposing internal 
interfaces and classes. The end result is that the public Predicate API 
provides only interfaces (Predicate, PagingPredicate, and 
PartitionPredicate) with no dependencies on internal APIs.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15142[#15142]
* Converted `Projection` to a functional interface so that it has become
lambda friendly.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15204[#15204]
* Converted the `Aggregator` abstract class to an interface.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15764[#15764]
* Converted the following custom query attribute abstract classes to
functional interfaces so that they have become
lambda friendly.
** `ArgumentParser`
** `ValueCallback`
** `ValueCollector`
** `ValueReader`
** `ValueExtractor`


==== API Package/Interface Changes

* Relocated the following classes:
** `com.hazelcast.monitor.LocalQueueStats` -> `com.hazelcast.collection.LocalQueueStats`
** `com.hazelcast.monitor.LocalExecutorStats` -> `com.hazelcast.executor.LocalExecutorStats`
** `com.hazelcast.monitor.LocalInstanceStats` -> `com.hazelcast.instance.LocalInstanceStats`
** `com.hazelcast.internal.management.JsonSerializable` -> `com.hazelcast.json.internal.JsonSerializable`

** `com.hazelcast.monitor.NearCacheStats` -> `com.hazelcast.nearcache.NearCacheStats`
** `com.hazelcast.monitor.LocalReplicatedMapStats` -> `com.hazelcast.replicatedmap.LocalReplicatedMapStats`
** `com.hazelcast.monitor.LocalTopicStats` -> `com.hazelcast.topic.LocalTopicStats`
+
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15888[#15888]
* Moved the `getXaResource()` method from the `TransactionContext` class
to `HazelcastInstance`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15728[#15728]
* Moved various private classes to internal packages.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15569[#15569],

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15888[#15888]
* The APIs that returned `UUID` string now returns `UUID`. These include `Endpoint.getUUID`,
listener registrations/deregistrations, keys of replica timestamps of `VectorClock`,
``UUID``s in the executor service, `UUID` in the `MigrationInfo`, cluster ID and transaction ID.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15473[#15473]
* Removed `ICompletableFuture` which was a replacement for the missing JDK
8's `CompletableFuture`. Now, it has been replaced by `CompletionStage`.
See https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15441[#15441] for more details.

[[enh-40]]
=== Enhancements

*_Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Enhancements:_*

* **Separating WAN Publisher Configuration:** The previously known `wan-publisher`
(or `WanPublisherConfig`) has been separated into two configuration elements
to be used for built-in and custom WAN publishers:
** `batch-publisher` (or `WanBatchPublisherConfig`)
** `custom-publisher`  (or `WanCustomPublisherConfig`)
+
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/index.html#defining-wan-replication[Defining WAN Replication section^]
* **Tracking WAN Synchronization Events:** Management Center, logs and diagnostics now report
the progress of a WAN synchronization. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15221[#15221]
* **Improvements in the JAAS Authentication Mechanism:**
** Aligned with JAAS best practices.
** Added support for the standard JAAS callbacks, i.e., `NameCallback` and `PasswordCallback`
** Avoided automatic deserialization of custom credentials in the client protocol.
** Introduce the concept of security roles to distinguish between (a single) connecting side identity and its privileges.
** Used `Credentials` object only for authentication to prevent secrets leaks.
** Cleaned up the `Credentials` interface.
+
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#jaas-authentication[JAAS Authentication section^]
* **Improvements in the Security Configuration:**
** Replaced the `<group>` configuration by simple `<cluster-name>`.
** Removed the `group-password` configuration.
** Introduced the concept of security realms on the members. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15651[#15651]
** Added typed authentication and identity configuration (e.g. `<ldap>` authentication, `<token>` identity)
** Used similar identity configuration in client config
+
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#changes-in-the-security-configuration[Hazelcast IMDG 4.0 Migration Guide^]
and link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#security[Security chapter^].
* **Javadoc for the Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Edition:** Added Javadoc JAR file
for the Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Edition.
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#getting-started[Getting Started section^]

*_Hazelcast IMDG Open Source Enhancements:_*

* **HTTPS for Scripts:** Enabled the REST endpoints for the `cluster.sh` and
`healthcheck.sh` scripts to use HTTPS. Before, they were
using HTTP. See the
link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#using-the-script-cluster-sh[cluster.sh^] and
link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#health-check-script[healthcheck.sh^] sections.
* **MapLoader with Custom time-to-live:** Introduced the `EntryStore` and `EntryLoader`
interfaces (adding expiration support for MapStore). See the
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/index.html#loading-and-storing-persistent-data[Loading and Storing Persistent Data section].
* **Moby Naming:** Introduced friendly names for the Hazelcast instances to be shown
in the Hazelcast Management Center. See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#checking-the-name-of-the-instance-for-rest-client[Checking the Instances' Name section^]. Also, a new system property, `hazelcast.member.naming.moby.enabled`, is introduced for this purpose.
* **Improved Client Performance:** Introduced a way to eliminate the sync backup
wait from the client and send the backup ACK to the client:
the smart clients have been made backup aware and the backups
now are redirected to the client directly from the backup members.
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#configuring-backup-acknowledgment[Configuring Backup Acknowledgment section^].
* **Ownerless Client:** Previously, the clients had an owner member
responsible for cleaning up their resources after they leave the cluster. Also, the
ownership information was needed to be replicated to the whole cluster when a client joins the cluster.
This mechanism have been made simpler by introducing the following system properties
to control the lifecycle of the clients on the member side:
** `hazelcast.client.cleanup.period.millis`
** `hazelcast.client.cleanup.timeout.millis`
+
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0/manual/html-single/#system-properties[System Properties section^].
* **Single Thread Hazelcast Clients Performance:** Hazelcast clients have been designed to be
used by multiple threads; the more threads you throw at it, the better the performance
(until it is saturated). Now, it has also been optimized for a single thread doing requests:
The default values for the `hazelcast.client.io.write.through` and `hazelcast.client.response.thread.dynamic`
have been changed from `false` to `true`.
* **JSON Support for REST:** Added support for `HazelcastJsonValue` over REST API: When a
`HazelcastJsonValue` is requested, now a UTF8 encoded JSON value is returned. The
response  has the JSON string in the payload and "Content-Type"
header is set to `application/json`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15017[#15017]

The following are the other improvements performed to solve the enhancement
issues opened by the Hazelcast customers/team.

* Removed the following duplicated MBeans since the metrics MBean
have been exposed:
** `ClientEngineMBean`
** `EventServiceMBean`
** `NetworkingServiceMBean`
** `OperationServiceMBean`
** `ProxyServiceMBean`
+
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16425[#16425]
* Renamed the `WanReplicationRef.setMergePolicy()` method
as `setMergePolicyClassName()` and made the `PassThroughMergePolicy`
the default merge policy for WAN replication if none is specified.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16403[#16403]
* Added convenience constructor for `SpringManagedContext`
to easily create it in the programmatic way.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16401[#16401]
* Added support for AWS PrivateLink. Now, Hazelcast IMDG
Java client can work with Hazelcast Cloud when it uses AWS PrivateLink.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16371[#16371]
* Added the `getOrCreate()` method to the client configuration
to fix the issue with `setInstanceName()` when using Spring Boot
and Hazelcast client.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/16362[#16362]
* Improved the Ringbuffer data structure so that it does not
throw `StaleSequenceException` when using `ReadManyOperation`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16303[#16303]
* Removed the shortened `mancenter` phrase from the source code.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16282[#16282]
* Removed the client side user executor and related configuration,
i.e., `executor-pool-size`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16215[#16215]
* Added the following client operations related to CP subsystem,
Hot Restart and WAN replication to be used by Management Center:
** `getCPMembers`
** `promoteToCPMember`
** `removeCPMember`
** `resetCPSubsystem`
** `triggerPartialStart`
** `triggerForceStart`
** `triggerHotRestartBackup`
** `interruptHotRestartBackup`
** `changeWanReplicationState`
** `clearWanQueues`
** `addWanReplicationConfig`
** `wanSyncMap`
** `checkWanConsistency`

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16262[#16262],
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16078[#16078]
* Added the support for `yml` extension, in addition to `yaml`,
for the Hazelcast configuration locator.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/16205[#16205]
* Improved the `IMap.putAll()` and `IMap.put()` behaviors
so that they match when they trigger listener events.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16144[#16144]
* Added option to disable retrieving the
`OSMBean.getFreePhysicalMemorySize()` method.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16039[#16039]
* The `recreateCachesOnCluster` invocation is not being checked
for the maximum invocations count anymore during cluster restarts.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16026[#16026]
* Introduced a special Java client type to be used by
Management Center.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16006[#16006]
* Removed the PID management from the IMDG start and stop
scripts. You can now start multiple Hazelcast instances, when
using the start script, without the need to create another
copy of the `/bin` directory, i.e., it now allows running
multiple processes.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15934[#15934]
* Added the cache statistics to the dynamically collected metrics
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15926[#15926]
* Removed `fail-on-maxbackoff` element in the connection retry
configuration and added `cluster-connect-timeout-millis`
instead to allow retrying with fixed amount of time
and shutdown after some time.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15923[#15923]
* Introduced cluster fail-fast when there are missing security
realms.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15872[#15872]
* Added `ConnectionRetryConfig` to `ClientConfigXmlGenerator`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15821[#15821]
* Renamed the `restart()` method of `CPSubsystemManagementService`
to `reset()`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15798[#15798]
* Unified the IMap and ICache eviction configurations to decrease
the configuration complexity.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15592[#15592]
* Introduced dynamic metric collection. Previously, Hazelcast metrics were 
reported programmatically to the Hazelcast Management Center, one by one. 
Introducing new metrics required changes both in IMDG and in MC, which limited the
number of metrics sent to MC. In 4.0 this has been changed to collecting and reporting 
all available metrics dynamically just by declaring them in IMDG. Besides reporting
the metrics dynamically to MC exposing them on JMX is done dynamically as well. 
Both reporting to MC and exposing on JMX are toggleable by using the `metric` 
configuration element introduced in 4.0.

* Set the log level to `FINEST` for `PartitionMigratingException`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15577[#15577]
* Added the support for nested JSON objects in arrays.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15425[#15425]
* To be shown on Management Center, the clients now send both its IP
address and canonical hostname. Before, only the hostname of the
client was shown.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15421[#15421]
* Added a new implementation of `SecondsBasedEntryTaskScheduler` for the
`FOR_EACH` mode to improve the performance of `TransactionContext.commit()`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15414[#15414]
* Added a level of memory protection to the Hazelcast client protocol:
untrusted connections (the ones which haven't finished
authentication yet) do not accept fragmented messages; they check the
frame size against a configurable limit.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15396[#15396]
* Made the Hazelcast specific root nodes in the YAML
configurations optional.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15389[#15389]
* Updated the `JavaVersion` class to support JDK 13 and 14 builds.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15372[#15372]
* Added support for updating the licenses of all the running
members of a Hazelcast IMDG cluster using the REST API.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15370[#15370]
* Introduced configuration of initial permits for CP subsystem
semaphore.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15208[#15208]
* Added support for null keys for the client side implementations of
`IMap.addEntryListener()`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15155[#15155]
* Improved the generics for the API with Projection, Predicate and EntryListener
by adding lower bounded wildcards to accept a wider range of parameters.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15153[#15153]
* Improved the performance of `TransactionLog.add()` by avoiding
the `LinkedList.remove()` call.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15111[#15111]
* Made `ClientConfig` to override `toString` as it is the situation
with `Config` to make it easier to troubleshoot.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15061[#15061]
* Added the full example configuration files (XML and YAML) for the
Hazelcast Java client.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15056[#15056]
* Introduced functional and serializable interfaces having a single
abstract method which declares a checked exception. The interfaces
are also serializable and can be readily used in the IMDG API when
providing a lambda which is then serialized.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14993[#14993]
* Enhanced the queries (read-only operations) in the CP Subsystem so that
they are executed with linearizability but they are not appended to the Raft log.
By this way, the grow of Raft logs and snapshots of read-only operations are
prevented, leading to throughput improvement
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14986[#14986]
* Improved the WAN feature so that now lazy deserialization is used
when merging entries received via WAN. Otherwise, the unconditional
deserialization was causing overhead.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14982[#14982]
* Updated the following packages to Java 8 and removed the
3.x rolling upgrade compatibility paths: cache, MultiMap, cluster,
partition, WAN replication, CP subsystem, Hot Restart.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14896[#14896]
* Added the support for Java 8 `Optionals` in the queries.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14827[#14827]
* Fixed the Javadoc markup issues.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14971[#14971]
* Updated the Hazelcast Kubernetes dependency to version 1.5.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14898[#14898]
* Cleaned up the Maven repositories in Hazelcast's `pom.xml`
to simplify the usage of Maven proxies.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14850[#14850]
* Updated the web session manager dependency to its latest
version.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14822[#14822]
* Separated the statistics for `IMap.set()` and `IMap.put()` methods.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14811[#14811]
* Introduced a warning log for illegal reflective access operation when
using Java 9 and higher, and OpenJ9.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14798[#14798]
* Added a method to easily identify when all replicas of a
partition have been lost: `allReplicasInPartitionLost()`
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/11983[#11983]
* Changed the Scheduled Executor's capacity value from "per partition"
to "per member".
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11629[#11629]
* Improved the fluent interface of configuration classes by adding
the `return this` statements to the setter methods.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/11107[#11107]
* Aligned the put mechanism for IMap and ICache: As in ICache,
now the put operations without time-to-live (TTL) in IMap makes an
entry either to live forever or use the TTL in the map's
configuration (if configured).
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10965[#10965]
* Added support for falling back to a "default" configuration for
the cache data structure.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10695[#10695]

[[fixes-40]]
=== Fixes

* Fixed an issue where disabling the quorum had not an effect
and was still checking the presence of split-brain protection.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/16510[#16510]
* Fixed an issue where the `Imap.containsKey()` method was not
able to find Near Cached entries when it is called from a
client.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/16462[#16462]
* Fixed an issue where the serializable singleton comparators
for natural and reverse order was creating new instances
on deserialization.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16439[#16439]
* Fixed the missing client XML/YAML configurations in `mvn assembly`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/16331[#16331]
* Fixed an issue where the Near Cache
was not being updated with the new value as soon as `putAsync`
future is completed, when local update policy is `CACHE_ON_UPDATE`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16314[#16314]
* Fixed an issue where the destruction of a proxy that is not
yet initialized was blocking on its construction, leading to the risk of deadlock.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16297[#16297]
* Fixed an issue where the `MembershipEvent.getMembers()` was
not returning the cluster member list in the proper order
at the time of event (when a new member joins).
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16243[#16243]
* Fixed an issue where the CP group IDs were not unique
for different CP subsystem initializations.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16240[#16240]
* Fixed an issue where a REST URI not matching any pattern
was returning a response belonging in `CLUSTER_WRITE` endpoint
group. Now, it throws an exception.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16237[#16237]
* Fixed the joining mechanism so that when the discovery
strategy is enabled, multiple join configurations are prevented.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16177[#16177]
* Fixed an issue where the client-side `HazelcastInstance`
was not throwing a configuration exception when there is a conflict
between the dynamic and static configurations.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/16165[#16165]
*  Fixed an issue where the configuration objects, that have
both implementation/class and name as the configuration, were
not equal after (de)serializations.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/16156[#16156]
* Eliminated the unnecessary iterations and object creations on
the bulk client responses.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16138[#16138]
* Fixed an issue where repetitive calls of `IMap.loadAll()`
may cause memory leaks.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/16096[#16096]
* Fixed an issue where `Address.equals()` and `hashCode` was
using hostname instead of IP addresses.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16075[#16075]
* Fixed an issue where a client in `CLIENT_DISCONNECTED` state
was not aware of possible attribute changes in the cluster after
its state becomes `CLIENT_CONNECTED`: Hazelcast now does not allow
changing member attributes after restarts.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16168[#16168]
* Fixed the inconsistency in Near Cache when using `CacheOnUpdate`:
Normally, a Near Cache is updated with get operations; another
option is `CacheOnUpdate` and when it is enabled, put operations also
update the Near Cache. To never miss any invalidation and never read
any stale data indefinitely, get based updates use reservations. With this fix,
this reservation based solution also applies to the put operations when
`CacheOnUpdate` is configured.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12548[#12548]
* Fixed an issue where `ProxyManager` was not removing `Proxy`
even after the original distributed object is destroyed.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12470[#12470]

[[fixes-40beta2]]
==== 4.0-Beta-2

* Fixed an issue where an HTTP request via
`hazelcast/rest/cluster` was failing when using the advanced network
configuration and a client endpoint is
not specified. In this case, this request's response
has been improved to report `0` as the client connection count.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16152[#16152]
* Fixed the following Hot Restart issues:
** Introduced an additional stage to the Hot Restart
procedure, i.e., `HotRestartIntegrationService.startup()`,
which waits until all members transition from the `PASSIVE` state.
This guarantees all members to have the same state after Hot
Restart operation is finished.
** IMap proxies created during Hot Restart are not initialized
and published to other cluster members. So the operation
has been improved to force initialize any uninitialized proxies
and publish them. This fixed the issue where the
`getDistributedObjects()` method was not reporting the persisted
objects after a Hot Restart.
+
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16116[#16116],
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15930[#15930]
* Forced eviction was evicting all the entries
regardless of the eviction configuration. This has
been fixed: forced eviction now runs only if a map has
eviction configured. Otherwise, it does not run and throws
native `OutOfMemoryException`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16085[#16085]
* Renamed the `GroupProperty` class as `ClusterProperty`
due to the `group` -> `cluster` term change.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16076[#16076]
* Fixed possible statistics miscalculations by checking an
entry's expiration in a Near Cache only if its state is
`READ_PERMITTED`
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16067[#16067]
* Fixed an issue where a `StreamSerializer` is added using
`setTypeClass` instead of `setTypeClassName`; this was not correctly handled.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/16047[#16047]
* Fixed an issue where some functions may not be working when
a client provides a new client type: removed `ClientType` and
`ConnectionType` enums and introduced free strings for them
instead.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16030[#16030]
* Fixed a race condition between the new cluster member join and post-join
operations executed as part of the concurrent member join.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16020[#16020]
* Fixed an issue where an enabled `redoOperation()` was not
throwing an exception when an empty list is tried to be retrieved
on the client.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16015[#16015]
* Aligned the exception mechanism of `CacheManager.createCache()`
with the `getCache()` and `getCacheManager().getCache()` methods of the
same class.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16007[#16007]
* Fixed an issue where a Raft node may leak and stay in the ACTIVE
state after a CP member terminates, because of a race between
the Hazelcast member shutdown and Raft node termination logic.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16022[#16022]
* Fixed an issue where gathering MultiMap statistics was breaking
the split-brain healing with `LatestAccessMergePolicy`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/16001[#16001]
* Fixed an issue where enabling REST API configuration
(`getRestApiConfig().setEnabled(true)`) was throwing
`NullPointerException` since its default value was null.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15981[#15981] 
* Fixed an issue where the configuration validator was not checking
if the maximum size policy is appropriate for the selected in-memory
format.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15964[#15964]
* Fixed an issue where `ManagementCenterService` was shutting down
itself when it encounters an exception during the creation of `TimedMemberState`.
This was causing the cluster to disappear from Management Center.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15946[#15946]
* Fixed an issue in the query operation for offloaded cases.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15944[#15944]
* Fixed the cache statistics handling: Previously used
`Config.findCacheConfig()` could only lookup
cache configurations added statically or dynamically
via `Config.addCacheConfig()`, but was missing configurations
of dynamically created caches via `CacheManager.createCache()`.
Now, `CacheService.getCacheConfigs()` is used to fix this.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15937[#15937]
* Fixed an issue where an exception thrown from a dynamic
metric provider was stopping the dynamic metric collector task.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15932[#15932]
* Fixed an issue where the map and Replicated Map in a client
share the same near cache when they have identical names.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15912[#15912]
* Fixed the extensive `Overwriting existing probe` logs when
starting a Hazelcast member.

was retrieved using an incorrect method.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15861[#15861]
* Fixed an issue where calling the `IMap.removeAll()` method
without index was updating the last access and expiry time
for all records.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15850[#15850]
* Fixed the consistency issue between the configuration replacers
and XML configuration imports.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15810[#15810]
* Fixed a configuration failure with YAML for composite
key indexes.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15806[#15806]

* Fixed an issue where the query cache was missing key and value
information for entries.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13423[#13423]

[[fixes-40beta1]]
==== 4.0-Beta-1

* Fixed an issue where a new CP member could create the Raft nodes before its
local CP member field is not initialized yet, when it is being promoted.
This could create non-determinism issues for CP groups relying on the
local CP member information.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15803[#15803]
* Fixed an issue where the `CompletableFuture#defaultExecutor()` method
caused compilation failure on JDK 9 due to the "protected" access.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15702[#15702]
* Fixed a race issue by initializing the local CP members before
initializing the metadata group.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15684[#15684]
* Fixed an issue where the CP subsystems' restart operations were
not being canceled and waiting the running/scheduled discovery tasks.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15567[#15567]
* Fixed an issue where the executor service message task
was blocking the partition thread.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15522[#15522]
* Fixed an issue where the used memory in metrics was becoming
a negative value.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15485[#15485]
* Moved the `checkWanReplicationQueues` operation from the caller side
to the callee. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15412[#15412]
* Fixed an issue where the map configuration options `readBackupData`
and `statisticsEnabled` were not being respected when a new
`MapConfig` is dynamically added from a client to a running Hazelcast cluster.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15382[#15382]
* Fixed an issue where the comparators were not able to act on
both keys and values. A custom paging predicate comparator may act on
keys and values at the same time even if only the keys are requested, e.g., using
the `IMap.keySet()` method. Before this fix only the keys were fetched for
this method, making comparators unable to act on values.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15380[#15380]
* Optimized the shutdown for on-heap indexes: These indexes are cleaned on shutdown and
the index entries are removed one by one. For large indexes, e.g.,
for array/collection attribute indexes, this was taking a considerable amount of time.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15340[#15340]
* Fixed the deserialization filtering for Externalizables and Deadlock in the
map index. The deserialization filter was not properly protecting against the
vulnerable Externalizable classes. The filtering has been extended.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15358[#15358]
* Fixed an issue where the named scheduled tasks was not respecting
the `HazelcastInstanceAware` marker.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15352[#15352]
* Fixed a possible `NullPointerException` for the `remove-if-same` map
operation.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15344[#15344]
* Fixed an issue where storing `MapStore` instances in `MapStoreConfig`
could cause member failures when the configuration is added
dynamically.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15224[#15224]
* Fixed a `NullPointerException` in the query caches by setting
the `publisher-listener-id` if a query cache has already one.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15215[#15215]
* Fixed an issue where `SimpleTokenCredentials` could not be
deserialized due to the missing handling in `SpiPortableHook`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15196[#15196]
* Fixed an issue where the commit phase of transactional maps
was not checking the member-wide upper limit for the entries in
write behind queues.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15186[#15186]
* Fixed an issue where the queries like `labels[any] = 0` and `labels[any] = 1`
were optimized only to `false` since `labels[any]` was interpreted as a
regular attribute name having a single value.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15163[#15163]
* For on-heap indexes, fixed an issue where a record's `lastAccessTime`
was not updated when it is being accessed through an index. 
Now, this way, the expiration `maxIdle` mechanism takes this into account.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15136[#15136]
* Fixed an issue where `ExecutorServiceProxy` was unnecessarily
serializing the same task multiple times before submitting it
to multiple members.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15069[#15069]
* Added the missing user code deployment section to the configuration
which is sent to Management Center.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15044[#15044]
* Fixed an issue where two client listeners are not registered since
they listen on a single connection (not cluster wide listeners) by
adding cleanups for them.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15041[#15041]
* Fixed the authentication mechanism between the clients and members
by adding a check to prevent re-verification while the client is changing
its owner member.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15030[#15030]
* Added support for the missing aliased discovery strategies,
e.g., `gcp` and `kubernetes`, to `ClientConfigXmlGenerator`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15010[#15010]
* Fixed an issue where the client user code deployment was
becoming non-operational when assertions are enabled.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/15006[#15006]
* Some operations such as heartbeat checks and partition
migrations share common threads with the client login module.
In case of the long running client login module implementations,
some symptoms such as split brain syndrome can be seen. This has
been fixed by introducing a blocking executor which is used only
for the client authentications.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14956[#14956]
* Fixed an issue where the `IMap.removeInterceptor()` method
was returning `void`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14955[#14955]
* Removed the `entryEvicted` event from the event firing mechanism
in the case of eviction. Before, both `entryEvicted` and `entryExpired`
events were being fired.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14954[#14954]
* Fixed an issue where the Hazelcast IMDG configuration files, that
have an extension other than `.xml`, `.yaml` or `.yml` or do not have
an extension, were ignored silently. This was happening
when the configuration file is set by using the `hazelcast.config`
system property.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14953[#14953]
* Fixed an issue where the client was not considering the new
address of a restarted member, which has the same UUID but could
have a different IP address after it is restarted.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14842[#14842]
* Fixed an issue where the migration operations were running
before the previous finalization is completed.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14832[#14832],
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16189[#16189]
* Fixed an issue where the outbound pipeline was not waking up
properly after various optimizations for write-through
persistence is made.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14831[#14831]
* Fixed an issue caused by the cache being not ready to be used
immediately after the cache proxy was created.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14821[#14821]
* Fixed an issue where the performance of `IMap.values()` was low when
using `PartitionPredicate`. Also, `PartitionPredicate` was not
respecting indexes. So, now global indexes are used for partition
queries.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14814[#14814]
* Fixed a performance issue where there were unneeded iterations and
object creations while converting the client messages to user objects.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/13784[#13784]
* Fixed an issue where the locked entries with a time-to-live were not evicted.
With this fix, the lock operation checks if an entry has already expired.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13272[#13272]
* Fixed an issue where there were excessive amount of logs on the target cluster
when `cache` config is missing for the WAN replication.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12826[#12826]
* Fixed an issue where there was an inconsistent `removeIf` behavior among the
collection views of IMap.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12198[#12198]
* Fixed a leak in the query cache due to `ListenerRegistrationHelper`, which
has been removed with this fix.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/11914[#11914]
* Fixed an issue where the `IMap.replace()` method was not loading entries
from the MapLoader when the keys could not be found in the memory.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11300[#11300]
