== 4.2.4

For the distributions packages of IMDG, we updated the vulnerable version of log4j2 in Management Center to 2.17.0. No changes were made to the IMDG code.

IMPORTANT: The 4.2.4 release notes for the Hazelcast distribution on Maven wrongly states that
log4j2 version has been updated to 2.15.0; it should be 2.17.0.
